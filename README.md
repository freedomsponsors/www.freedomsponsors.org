FreedomSponsors is a platform for supporting free/libre software projects through microcrowdfunding – that is, crowdfunding individual open source project’s issues.

http://freedomsponsors.org lets you help the Open Source projects you love by creating and collecting bounties.

How it works:

* 1) A sponsor places a bounty for an issue.
* 2) Other sponsors might places more bounties for the same issue.
* 3) A developer resolves the issue.
* 4) The sponsors verify the fix and pay the developer.

FreedomSponsors is a system strongly based on trust and reputation.

In this repo you'll find the full source code that powers FS (backend and frontend).
