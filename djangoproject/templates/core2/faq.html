			<h3 class="green-text">What is FreedomSponsors?</h3>
			<p>FreedomSponsors is a crowdfunding platform for programming tasks of Free and Open Source Software.</p>
			<p>You can place money bounties for issues that you care about getting fixed, and you can collect bounties by working on open issues.</p>

			<h3 class="green-text">What makes FreedomSponsors different from other crowdfunding sites?</h3>
			<p>The main difference is that we are focused on helping the Open Source and Free Software community.</p>
			<p>But we believe that what really makes us unique is that we have a strong philosophy based on openness and freedom.</p>
			<p>That philosophy means we put the community first in everything we do. Here's a few examples:</p>
			<ul class="bullet">
				<li>
					<p>We want to build a community based on trust and reputation. Sponsors only have to pay their bounty after the developer resolves the issue (but you can choose to pay before, if you wish.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>We want to build free, libre, open source software. Our users' software freedom is important to us, so <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/www.freedomsponsors.org">this website is libre/open source</a> on the front-end <span class="bold">and the back end</span>. We don't use third-party javascript code that can allow our users' online activities to be spied on. This includes Google Analytics, Facebook Like buttons, and things like that. We also follow the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">FSF guidelines for free, libre javascript code</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>We want to be the change we wish to see in the world.
					We're "open everything", so everything we do is out in the open:
					Check out our <a href="/stats/">website statistics</a>,
					browse our <a href="http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/">blog</a>,
					and see the way we handle all <a href="{% url 'core.views.feedback_views.feedback' %}">feedback</a>.
					It has a lot in common with the <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">"open company" concept</a>
					pioneered by our friends at <a href="http://gittip.com">Gittip</a>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- TODO: Yes. It is working and we have already paid developers $TOTAL_SENT to work on $TOTAL_ISSUES for $TOTAL_PROJECTS. (Until then, -->
			<p>Yes. Honestly, we do.</p>
			<p>We believe that there are enough decent, honest people in the world for this to work.</p>
			<p>A wise guy once said, stay foolish. We intend to do just that.</p>
			<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_agile">the Agile Manifesto</a>? FreedomSponsors is all about taking the third Agile principle to its ultimate consequence: <span class="bold">"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation."</span></p>
			<p>We want to give people the ability to push forwards the projects they love. No contracts, just trust that developers also love these projects too, and feel happy when they can be paid to put more work into them.</p>

			<h3 class="green-text">How do I change my profile picture?</h3>
			<p>Use <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>.</p>
			<p>Gravatar is a nice and simple online service that will let you upload avatar pictures and associate them with an email address.</p>
			<p>For example, the email tony@freedomsponsors.org is linked to <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2f9b553e184602579b920053952ce4c.png?s=160">this image</a>.</p>

		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">How can I tell if a sponsor is serious about his offer?</h3>
			<p>Like eBay, you should check out their profile and take a look at their history. If there are a lot of unpaid offers on resolved issues, that's a bad sign.</p>

		<a name="What about privacy?"></a>
		<div class="vgap-30"><!-- Vertical Gap 30px --></div>
		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">What about privacy?</h3>
			<p>Our purpose is to do business in public. We don't show your email address, but everything that you do here (making an offer, saying you'll work on an issue, all your comments) is public for the world to see.</p>
		</div>
		<a name="How do payments work?"></a>
		<div class="vgap-30"><!-- Vertical Gap 30px --></div>
		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">How do payments work?</h3>
			<p>Payments can be made either in USD via Paypal, or in <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoins</a></p>

			<p>If you don't have a Paypal account, setting up one is very easy and you can do it when you're making your first payment.<br>
			Setting up a bitcoin wallet is also very easy, see <a href="#What is Bitcoin?">"What is Bitcoin?"</a>.</p>

			<p>Before you can receive payments, we recommend you have both a Paypal account and a Bitcoin address so you can accept all offers. We check that each Paypal account is valid before allowing anyone to make a payment to it.</p>

			<p>FreedomSponsors charges a 3% fee on top of offers, regardless of the payment method. We clearly state this on each payment page. To keep things simple, we use Paypal’s <span class="bold">Parallel</span> payment type, so a single payment is sent to two or more receivers.</p>
			<p>For example, when you want to pay a US$ 100 bounty, you may decide to give US$ 50 each to 2 developers. On Paypal’s website, you will see:</p>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Developer A: USD $50</li>
				<li>Developer B: USD $50</li>
				<li>FreedomSponsors' 3% fee: USD $3</li>
				<li>PayPal's Fee: USD $4.60 (may vary)</li>
				<li>-----------------------------------------------------------</li>
				<li>TOTAL: USD $107.60</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>Bitcoin has no “parallel payment.” Instead, you send us, we verify the transaction, keep 3%, and transfer the rest to the developer(s) being paid.</p>
			<p>
                Since our system is libre, you can review the code that processes transactions for both

		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">I don't have a Paypal account or a Bitcoin wallet, is that ok?</h3>
			<p>To be able to <span class="bold">receive</span> payments, you’ll need to set up one of these options on <a href="{% url 'core.views.user_views.editUserForm' %}">your profile page</a>. </p>

			<p>If you're sponsoring issues, you don't need that until right before making your payment. If you made an offer in USD and you don't have a Paypal account, you'll be prompted to setup one when you're making your first payment (and it's very easy to do so).</p>

			<p>If you don't know what Bitcoin is, you should! <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/en/">This short video</a> (1m44s) does an excellent job explaining it.</p>

			<p>If you still don’t have a Bitcoin Wallet, it’s really easy to set up one – and it’s free.
			You can either host your wallet on your computer using a Bitcoin client, or you can create a wallet online in a web wallet provider. Take a look at this link to learn more about those options: <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet</a></p>

		<div class="vgap-30"><!-- Vertical Gap 30px --></div>
		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">Two developers are claiming to have resolved my issue. What should I do? </h3>
			<p>First, verify that the issue is really solved. It's perfectly OK to pay only after your problem is really fixed.</p>
			<p>Then you have to decide whether you'll pay developer A, developer B, or both. To make a fair choice, do a little digging and check out the original issue to see how it went down.</p>
			<p>Maybe one person submitted a pull request for a bugfix, and another person had to rework it and then merged it. If so, they both deserve some thanks, and your money. You decide how much you pay to whom. The choice is yours.</p>

		<div class="vgap-30"><!-- Vertical Gap 30px --></div>
		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">How a fix done by an independent developer will return back to the main project (trunk)?</h3>
			<p>Ideally, there should be no "independent developers".
			The best way for a developer to contribute to an open source project is to actually get involved
			with the corresponding community.</p>
			<p>In most cases, it is also a bad thing for the end user (meaning, the sponsor) if the work is done
			on a branch, or a fork of the main codebase, because then the user would not benefit from new improvements
			that eventually get added in the future.</p>
			<p>The "Sponsor issue" form has a "No Forking" checkbox as part of the acceptance criteria.
			By checking it, the sponsor is telling that only solutions that are implemented on the main project's
			codebase will be accepted.</p>
			<p>We want to encourage sponsors to actually fund the original projects, so that checkbox comes checked by default.</p>

		<a name="I resolved an issue, but the sponsor just didn't pay me. What can I do?"></a>
		<div class="vgap-30"><!-- Vertical Gap 30px --></div>
		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">I resolved an issue, but the sponsor just didn't pay me. What can I do?</h3>
			<p>Normally we have an atmosphere of gratitude and collaboration among sponsors and developers.
			However we do know that conflict situations may come up.</p>
			<p>Try to resolve conflict with compassion.
			An excellent book that explains how to do this is <a href="http://www.cnvc.org">Marshall Rosenberg's
			"Non-Violent Communication: A Language of Life"</a>.</p>
			<p>Simply, tell them how you feel without judging them or evaluating the situation, then request a description
			of what their ideal situation is, and ask for suggestion about how to get there.</p>
			<p>If you feel upset, and judge the sponsor as not trustworthy, remember that the issue - and its comment
			history - will be publicly linked to the sponsor's account.
			If you feel unhappy, we suggest you go to sleep before posting anything you might later regret.</p>
			<!-- TODO In the worst case, you can mark an issue as 'CONFLICTED.'
			Next to every username is the PAID/CONFLICTED score,
			which shows the total number of issues the user is involved in that are now PAID or CONFLICTED.
			EG, "davelab6 57/1" in green/red. -->

		<div class="vgap-30"><!-- Vertical Gap 30px --></div>
		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">Can I get paid before I complete the issue?</h3>
			<p>Yes. When you start working on an issue, simply check the “start accepting payments” box, and kindly ask your patrons to pay you.</p>
			<p>We recommend only doing this when you're confident that you will be able to complete the issue.
               If you think the total payment should be higher, track down some other users who suffer
                from this issue and ask them to check it out on FreedomSponsors.</p>

		<div class="fs-box">
			<h3 class="green-text">
			Can I send a payment before the issue is completed?
			</h3>
			<p>It depends.</p>
			<p>Normally you have to wait until the developer has marked the issue as “DONE”.</p>
			<p>However you can do this when the issue is
			<!-- TODO remove the _ from this throughout the site -->
			“IN_PROGRESS” <span class="bold">and</span> the developer has indicated that they wish to start accepting payments.
			But remember that it's ok to wait until the issue is finished before you pay the developer.</p>
			<p>We encourage you to only pay beforehand to developers you know you can trust!</p>
