    <p>You created this offer here on FreedomSponsors, but the guys working on <a href="{{offer.issue.project.homeURL}}" target="_project">{{offer.issue.project.name}}</a> don't know about it yet.</p>
    <p>The best way to let them know is to post a comment on the <a href="{{offer.issue.trackerURL}}" target="_issue">original issue</a>.<br>
      Go ahead and copy the text below if you like:

          I care about getting this fixed, so I'm offering {{myoffer.currency}} {{myoffer.price}} to the first person to fix it. <br> <br>

          If you're not able to fix this yourself but you care about it too, throw in a few bucks with me and we'll get it fixed faster :) <br> <br>

          The offer is made at {{SITE_HOME}}{{offer.issue.get_view_link}} so if you fix this issue (according to the acceptance criteria described there) please use that site to let everyone know.
